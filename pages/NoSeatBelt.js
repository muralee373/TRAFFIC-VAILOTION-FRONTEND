          <h3>Why is Wearing a Seatbelt Important?</h3>
          <p>
            Seatbelts are one of the most effective safety measures in vehicles. 
            They prevent passengers from being ejected during accidents and reduce 
            the severity of injuries by distributing force across stronger body parts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Studies have shown that wearing a seatbelt reduces the risk of death in 
            car crashes by 45% for front-seat passengers and 60% for rear-seat passengers.
