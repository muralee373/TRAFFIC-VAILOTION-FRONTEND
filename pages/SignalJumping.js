          <h3>Red Light Jumping Challan â€“ Things to Know</h3>
          <p>
            You will have to pay a jumping red light fine if you break the signal or violate the traffic rule. 
            You will be given a red light jump challan of Rs. 1,000 for breaking or not following the traffic signal or light. 
            Prior to the Motor Vehicle Act amendment, a fine of roughly Rs. 100-300 was chargeable as the red light jump fine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The signal jump challan penalty is similar for all vehicles which are breaking the signals on roads. 
            This is not dependent on the specific vehicle type.
